# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document provides some answers to questions that frequently get asked within our community.

## Do you have a Roadmap?

[https://roadmap.polyphony.chat](https://roadmap.polyphony.chat)
Dates listed on that page are not necessarily correct and merely a projection.

## How can I help?

Read the
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md) before doing anything!

If there is a project that you are especially interested in, you can always ask about things that
need help here.

For polyproto specifically, please take a look at <https://polyproto.org/docs/contribute>.
It lists ways you can contribute regardless of the programming language you prefer.

## How far along is this project? Can I use it right now?

Polyphony in its current form is a passion project led by people with real-life responsibilities such
as education, a job and/or family to take care of. Despite this, the project is being contributed towards
regularly.

Polyphony is not yet at a stage where you can use it to communicate with other people using a
server and/or client application.

## What about encryption, secrecy and anonymity?

Encryption with minimal clear-text metadata and great usability is a topic we are actively working
towards as we develop the polyproto protocol, the polyproto-chat APIs and the Polyphony Chat
server and client applications. Anonymity as a feature is not planned, however.

## How can I reach out to Polyphony developers and/or the Polyphony community?

### Email

You can reach us at [info@polyphony.chat](mailto:info@polyphony.chat) for general inquiries and
[security@polyphony.chat] if you'd like to address or disclose an immediate safety or security
concern. Emails sent to these addresses can be read by people with the **Maintainer** role and by
the project lead themselves. "Regular" contributors do not have a polyphony email account.

### Discord

Quite ironic, no?

You can join our Discord Guild through <https://discord.com/invite/m3FpcapGDD>. The channels listed
under [the IRC section](#irc) are bridged to an IRC server. This means, that your Discord nickname
and message contents will be sent to that IRC server, should you send a message in one of these
channels.

### IRC

Communication on our Discord Guild is bridged to several IRC channels, so that people may partake
in the Polyphony community without having to have a Discord.com account.

[`irc.libera.chat:6697`](https://libera.chat/) is hosting our channels.

The following channels are bridged between Discord and IRC:

`##polyphony.announcements`
`##polyphony.community-updates`
`##polyphony.github`
`##polyphony.ci`
`##polyphony.chit-chat`
`##polyphony.rustaeceans`
`##polyphony.media`
`#polyphony.discussion`
`#polyphony.polyproto-discussion`
`#polyphony.server-discussion`
`#polyphony.chorus-discussion`

(Yes, there is a distinction between `#` and `##`).
