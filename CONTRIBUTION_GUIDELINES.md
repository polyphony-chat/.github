# Contribution Guidelines

If you ever feel like wanting to help out with anything, please do! Any help at all is very, very much appreciated.
Refactors, cleanups, new features, bugfixes - i'll take it all!

A good place to start right now is by looking at the Chorus or Symfonia repositories and their roadmaps. 

If you want to contribute code, please follow these steps:
- Find a feature or issue you want to work on. If you want to work on something that is not listed, open an issue and we will discuss it.
- **Let it be known in the issue that you are working on it.** This is to avoid duplicate work, especially since currently this project is still in its early stages and there are not many contributors.
- Fork the Project
- Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)
- Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')
- Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
- Open a Pull Request
