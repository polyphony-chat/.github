<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About

This organization currently hosts two projects:
**Chorus**, a library for connecting to Discord.com and Spacebar-compatible APIs and Gateways, and **Polyphony**, a multi-instance, Discord/Spacebar API-compatible chat client written in Rust and Svelte (TypeScript) using Tauri.

## Chorus

[Visit the Chorus repository here](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/chorus)

Chorus is a library that aims to provide a simple, easy-to-use interface for connecting to Spacebar instances. It is written in Rust and is currently in development.

The chorus library makes up a big part of the Polyphony client, but it is also intended to be used in other projects.

The library is currently in a very early stage and is not yet ready for use.

## Polyphony

![Product Mockup](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/polyphony/blob/main/images/mockup.png?raw=true)
<cite>*A mockup of the Polyphony client.*</cite>

Polyphony will be a multi-instance, Discord/Spacebar API-compatible chat client, written in Rust and Svelte (TypeScript) using Tauri. The three goals of this project are ease-of-use, user experience and performance.

Ideally, you will be able to connect to multiple Spacebar instances at the same time and use the client just like you would expect a regular Discord client to work.

## Spacebar? What's that?

[Go read about the Spacebar project here!](https://github.com/spacebarchat) Spacebar describes itself as "*a free open source selfhostable discord compatible chat, voice and video platform*".
