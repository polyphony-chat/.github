<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

Proprietary chat services suck. Polyphony aims to replicate the experience currently offered by 
popular, proprietary chat services such as Discord, while improving upon this strong base, by
offering strong security, privacy, interoperability, less unnecessary features and being free and open source - forever.

- **Spacebar compatible** - Polyphony is designed to work with the [Spacebar protocol](https://github.com/spacebarchat), a Discord-API compatible chat protocol.
- **Discord compatible** - Use Polyphony to communicate with your friends who are still using Discord.
- **Self-hosted** - Polyphony is designed to be self-hosted, allowing you to host your chat server, similar to Matrix or TeamSpeak.
- **Open Source** - Polyphony is open source, allowing you to audit the code and ensure that it is secure. The code is also available for you to modify and redistribute under the GPL-3.0 license.
- **Secure** - A publicly auditable codebase, end-to-end encryption, and a focus on security ensure, that your messages are secure.
- **Lightweight, Fast and Memory-Safe** - Polyphony is written entirely in Rust, a fast, memory-safe and modern programming language, ensuring that Polyphony inherits these properties.

Please note that the above table represents our core goals for the project, and as of now does not fully 
represent the actual state of the codebase.
