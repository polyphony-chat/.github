<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

Proprietary chat services suck. The Polyphony project aims to create easy to use, federated and secure communications software and protocols.

### Our Goals

- **Re-imagine federation and identity**: With [polyproto](https://docs.polyphony.chat/Overviews/core/),
  we are creating a modern, simple and resilient identity federation and trusted message exchange
  protocol which is ready for real-world happenings such as instances shutting down or being
  unreachable. We want to make federation feasible for everyone, not just tech-savvy people.
  *polyproto-chat* is a new chat protocol built on top of polyproto, which can be implemented and
  extended upon by anyone.
- **Create modern, reliable and easy to use chat software**: With
  [client](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/client),
  [chorus](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/chorus) and
  [symfonia](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/symfonia), we are developing an alternative to
  proprietary chat services. We are compatible with [Spacebar Chat](https://spacebar.chat), an
  open-source re-implementation of the Discord API, which means that you can use Polyphony with
  Spacebar and other services that are compatible with this API. No need to leave behind your
  friends who are using other services!
- **Be open, stay open**: Through the MPL-2.0 license, we ensure that our software can be used by
  anyone, for any(-ish) purpose. The only thing we ask is that improvements and changes to our software
  stay open source as well. Our software should benefit the general public, not corporations.

## Repositories

We are currently working on the following things:

| Repository                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [polyproto-rs](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/polyproto-rs) | A modern, simple and secure identity federation and trusted message exchange protocol. Rust implementation. Reference implementation in Rust.                |
| [symfonia](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/symfonia)         | Our chat server, built on polyproto-chat.                                                                                                                    |

| [client](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/client)             | Modern and cross plattform Client for Polyphony. Currently not being worked on, as we focus on developing a solid client library, server and protocol first. |
