<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

Proprietary chat services suck. Polyphony aims to replicate and improve upon the experience currently
offered by popular, proprietary chat services, while also providing a secure, private, open-source
and interoperable alternative.

- **Spacebar compatible** - Polyphony is designed to work with [Spacebar](https://github.com/spacebarchat), a Discord-API-compatible chat service.
- **Self-hosted** - Polyphony is designed to be self-hosted, allowing you to host your own chat server, similar to Matrix or TeamSpeak.
- **Open Source** - Polyphony is open source, allowing you to audit the code and ensure that it is secure. The code is also available for you to modify and redistribute under the GPL-3.0 or AGPL-3.0 licenses.
- **Secure** - A publicly auditable codebase, end-to-end encryption (soon), and a focus on security ensure, that your messages are secure.
- **Lightweight, Fast and Memory-Safe** - Polyphony is written in Rust, a fast, memory-safe and modern programming language, ensuring that Polyphony inherits these properties.
